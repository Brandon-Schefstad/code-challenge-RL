# Prompt:

    Please share samples of code you've personally written for one or two completed BackendÂ projects. The samples can be from personal, academic, or professional projects. Here are some guidelines to help provide more context on what we're looking for:

    + Code that is clean and maintainable
    + There is some type of design pattern followed (MVVM, etc)
    + Solid understanding of BackendÂ domain knowledge (navigation, state management, etc).
    + Code that you wrote. If it is a team project, please include the git history with the repo so we can clearly know what you worked on vs the rest of the team.

    You can either reply to this email with zip file(s) attached or send us GitHub link(s). If you do not have any up to date work, we encourage you to take our coding challenge which can be found attached to this email. ðŸ¦–
